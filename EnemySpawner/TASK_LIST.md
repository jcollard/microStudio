## Step Implementation Tasks

**IMPORTANT PROCESS NOTE:**
> **Stop after completing each step to get feedback and approval before proceeding to the next step.**
>
> After completing each step HTML file:
> 1. Test the step in the browser (verify code rendering, copy buttons, layout)
> 2. Verify all `renderCodeBlock()` and `renderDiffBlock()` calls work correctly
> 3. Check that inline `<script>` tags execute properly
> 4. Confirm demo placeholder is included (or intentionally removed)
> 5. Present to user for review and approval
> 6. Make any requested changes
> 7. Only proceed to next step after explicit approval
>
> This iterative approach ensures quality and alignment with expectations at each stage.
