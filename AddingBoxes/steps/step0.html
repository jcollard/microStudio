<h2>Welcome! 🚀</h2>
<div class="step-content">
    <p>Congratulations on completing the Collision Detection Challenge! You've learned how collision detection works with boxes bouncing off each other.</p>

    <p>Now it's time to apply what you've learned to your <strong>Space Game</strong>! In this lesson, you'll add collision detection so your lasers can actually hit the enemy googly eyes.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>🎯 What You'll Build</h3>
        <p>By the end of this lesson, your space game will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have bounding boxes around the googly eyes (enemies)</li>
            <li>Be able to detect when lasers collide with enemies</li>
            <li>Use the same collision detection code from your previous challenge</li>
            <li>Visualize the bounding boxes to help you debug</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
        <h3>📋 What You'll Learn</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>How to refactor code to use the <code>create_box</code> function</li>
            <li>How to add bounding boxes to game objects</li>
            <li>How to visualize collision boundaries for debugging</li>
            <li>How to reuse code from one project in another</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>✅ Prerequisites</h3>
        <p>Before starting this lesson, make sure you have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completed the <strong>Collision Detection Challenge</strong></li>
            <li>Understanding of the <code>create_box</code> function</li>
            <li>Understanding of the <code>boxes_colliding</code> function</li>
            <li>Basic knowledge of tables and functions in Lua</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>💡 Important Note</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we'll start by working with a <strong>practice project</strong> that you can clone. This allows you to learn the concepts safely without breaking your existing space game.</p>
        <p>Once you're comfortable with the changes, you can apply them to your own project!</p>
